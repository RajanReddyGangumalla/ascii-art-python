# 🎨 ASCII Art Generation Using Python

## 📌 Introduction

This project demonstrates how complex visual patterns can be created in the terminal using ASCII characters and pure Python logic.

Instead of displaying an image file, the program prints an image-like structure using characters such as `+`, `*`, `#`, `%`, and `@`.

The main objective of this minor project is to understand pattern printing, nested loops, and logical thinking through a creative implementation.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Generate ASCII art using Python
- Understand nested loops and character repetition
- Create image-like output without using external libraries
- Improve logical and pattern-based programming skills

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Language: Python
- Editor: Visual Studio Code
- Version Control: Git & GitHub

---

## ⚙️ Working Principle

- The ASCII image is constructed row by row.
- Each row is generated using loops that control:
  - Number of characters
  - Type of ASCII symbols used
- Background areas use lighter characters (`+`).
- Detailed and darker areas use dense characters (`#`, `%`, `@`, `*`).
- No hard-coded image strings are used; the output is created logically.

---

## ✅ Key Features
